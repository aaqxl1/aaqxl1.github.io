Developed an Ai Machine Learning model using **Python** and data science techniques to predict if patients have Liver Disease. This Project was part of my Honors Assignment in Liverpool John Moores University. The project stages:
- Cleaning the raw dataset which included patient details from a hospital in india.
- Analyzing the data using various libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikitlearn.
- Visualizing the data to understand the dataset better, mainly utilizing seaborn for bar charts, jointplots and scatterplots.
- Using 3 different machine learning models, then picking the most suitable model based on their test scores.

## Tableau Dashboards

### Maven Sales Challenge Dashboard <br>

The Maven Analytics Data Challenge involves the creation of an interactive dashboard for MavenTech, a company specializing in computer hardware sales to large businesses. As a BI Developer, my primary objective is to provide sales managers with a tool to monitor quarterly performance based on data sourced from a CRM database. <br><br>

### Global CO2 Emissions <br>

This project focuses on three key objectives. Firstly, a dynamic line chart depicted the percentage share of CO2 emissions by year for the top 10 countries. Secondly, a country-level map illustrated CO2 emissions per capita in 2021. Lastly, a scatter plot compared CO2 emissions and population, with bubble sizes indicating Temperature Change From CO2 in 2021, complemented by a linear regression trend line.
Through these visualizations, the project provided actionable insights into the relationship between CO2 emissions, population dynamics, and environmental impacts, empowering informed decision-making to address climate change globally. <br><br>

### Data Science Module Project <br>

This dashboard represents the culmination of my efforts in analyzing data provided by the university, where I delved into data cleaning within Tableau, employing custom splits and proficiently handling null values.

üéì Developed as part of my Applied Data Science module at Liverpool John Moores University, this dashboard showcases an array of insightful charts:

üó∫Ô∏è Map: Visualizing product quantity by state. <br>
üìä Side-by-Side Bar Chart: Breaking down product quantity by cities within states. <br>
üå≤ Tree Map: Illustrating total USD spent by each state on products. <br>
üîç Highlight Table: Comparing total quantity sold and total USD spent per product. <br>
üìà Bar Chart: Identifying the most ordered products across states. <br>

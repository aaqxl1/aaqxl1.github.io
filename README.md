Developed an Ai Machine Learning model using **Python** and data science techniques to predict if patients have Liver Disease. This Project was part of my Honors Assignment in Liverpool John Moores University. The project stages:
- Cleaning the raw dataset which included patient details from a hospital in india.
- Analyzing the data using various libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikitlearn.
- Visualizing the data to understand the dataset better, mainly utilizing seaborn for bar charts, jointplots and scatterplots.
- Using 3 different machine learning models, then picking the most suitable model based on their test scores.

This project is meticulously structured around three pivotal objectives. Initially, a dynamic line chart captures the evolving percentage share of CO2 emissions by year, spotlighting the top 10 countries. Following this, a comprehensive country-level map delineates CO2 emissions per capita for the year 2021. Lastly, a sophisticated scatter plot delves into the intricate interplay between CO2 emissions and population, accentuated by bubble sizes representing Temperature Change From CO2 in 2021, further enhanced by a discerning linear regression trend line.

These meticulously crafted visualizations serve as a beacon of insight, unraveling the intricate relationship between CO2 emissions, population dynamics, and their profound environmental repercussions. By empowering stakeholders with actionable insights, this project fosters informed decision-making essential for tackling the global challenge of climate change. <br><br>

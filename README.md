Developed an Ai Machine Learning model using **Python** and data science techniques to predict if patients have Liver Disease. This Project was part of my Honors Assignment in Liverpool John Moores University. The project stages:
- Cleaning the raw dataset which included patient details from a hospital in india.
- Analyzing the data using various libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikitlearn.
- Visualizing the data to understand the dataset better, mainly utilizing seaborn for bar charts, jointplots and scatterplots.
- Using 3 different machine learning models, then picking the most suitable model based on their test scores.
